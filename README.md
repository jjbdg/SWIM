# Virtual Reality on a SWIM: Scalable World in Miniature
<p> The SWIM was developed and published as part of the 3D User Interfaces Contest at the IEEE Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 2022 Conference in Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>

#### Abstract
<p> With the general World-in-Miniature (WIM) technique, users are unable to adjust the sizing of the objects in the miniature copy or the view that it displays. We propose the Scalable World in Miniature (SWIM) which affords independent scaling and finer control across a spectrum of object sizes. By treating the WIM as an independently scalable volume of interest, users can set specific objects and subsections or the entire environment as the miniature modelâ€™s view to a convenient scale. Only the objects displayed in the WIM can be interacted with, allowing for more natural interactions with objects of different scale factors. </p>

<p> Developed with Unity 2021 on the Oculus Quest (designed for any general VR system). </p>
  
#### How to Interact with the Environment

<ol>
  <li> Grab objects with either the grip button, or by pointing and using the triggers.
  <li> Select the focus of the WIM with simple pointing and holding the secondary button on either controller.
  <li> Use the distance between hands to set the scale of the objects in the WIM.
  <li> Release the button and interact with any of the objects!
</ul>
